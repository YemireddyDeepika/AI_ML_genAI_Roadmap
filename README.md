# AI / Machine Learning / Generative AI Roadmap

##  Overview
This repository documents my **structured learning journey and hands-on practice** in  
**Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI** using Python.

The goal is to build **strong fundamentals**, apply them through **real-world projects**, and become **job-ready for AI/ML roles**.

---

##  Career Objective
To secure an entry-level / junior role as:
- Machine Learning Engineer
- AI Engineer
- Data Scientist (Fresher / Junior)
- Generative AI Engineer

by building a strong **project-driven portfolio**.

---

##  Skills Covered
- Python for Data Science  
- NumPy & Pandas  
- Data Visualization  
- Machine Learning Algorithms  
- Deep Learning (ANN, CNN, RNN)  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Generative AI (LLMs, RAG, Chatbots)  
- Model Deployment (Flask / FastAPI)  
- Git & GitHub
